CSE 598 Paper on Model Driven Analysis

Abstract:
It has long been the dream of managers to eliminate computer programmers.  Model Driven Architecture is the latest in a series of attempts to accomplish this.  We review flowcharting, mainly for historical interest, UML, and BPMN for use in Model Driven Architecture.  Based on the pros and cons of these approaches, we make a cautious recommendation for the use of Model Driven Architecture in developing new enterprise applications.
